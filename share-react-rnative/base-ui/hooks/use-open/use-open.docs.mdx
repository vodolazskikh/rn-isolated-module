## A React Hook to increment a count

Increments the state of `count` by 1 each time `increment` is called

### Component usage

In this example clicking the button calls `increment` which increments the `count` by 1

```js
import { BasicUseOpen } from './use-open.composition';

<BasicUseOpen />;
```
